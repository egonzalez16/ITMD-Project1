  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Emmanuel Gonzalez and am in my fourth year undergrad student looking 
  to complete my bachelors in computer science. I would consider myself a social person 
  though I wouldn't go as far as to say that I am extroverted. </p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I mainly enjoy playing video games, I recently have been having fun playing Super Smash Bros and Overwatch as of late 
  but have put in a lot of hours in games like League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, COD, etc. Besides gaming I watch a lot 
  of movies/shows with my friends and spend a lot of time listening to music.</p>
